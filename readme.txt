The scripts that have #!/usr/bin/env/bash shebang are the ones I made while learning.
I made them myself and then checked the code after completion.
I'm adding them because otherwise it looks like I did not do much.

The script with the #!/bin/bash shebang are the ones that took me a bit longer to do since I wrote them from scratch and with no reference.


Scripts pfunc.sh and count_files_in_directory.sh have the same goal. One does it with a loop and the other uses ls and wc.
